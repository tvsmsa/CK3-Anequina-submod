2.1) Anequina - positive Anequinan opinion, martial buff, diplomacy buff, +20% prestige, negative Zealous opinion

3) Events for already existing decisions:

3.1) Anequina decision - flavour, get nickname and some prestige

## TO-DO:

1) Decision to invade Skingrad. Need to do Restore Darloc Brae Empire decision first

2) Modifiers for already existing decisions
2.1) Leyawiin decision - positive Khajiit opinion (very positive Malaapit opinion if chose them), negative Imperial opinion. Modifier for Leaywiin county (way better if Malaapit, they flourish).

2.2) Arenthia decision - positive Khajiit opinion, negative Bosmer opinion, possibly negative Imperial opinion, maybe diplomacy or intrigue buff. Modifier for Arenthia county (or Rawl'kha).

3) Do'krin special building 

4) Events for already existing decisions

4.1) Leaywiin decision - decide whether to settle your own culture (Anequinan) or Malaapit. Malaapit modifier is way better (Malaapit get Leyawiin county and possibly duchy), but you give away Leaywiin. Or settle your culture and keep Leyawiin.

4.2) Arenthia decision - either just flavour for Arenthia(it gets modifier) or move Arenthia's capital to Rawl'kha and it gets modifier instead(it auto converts culture and faith, maybe add negative modifier for Arenthia).

5) Restore Darloc Brae Empire: conquer Arenthia and Leaywiin, max prestige level. Very good modifier for all Anequinan counties.

6) Alabasti decision possibly.

7) More Skingrad and later Cyrodiil stuff.

8) Drive out Imperials minor decision (only for kingdom of Rimmen)
