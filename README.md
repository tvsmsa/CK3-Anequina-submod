## TO-DO:

1) Decision to invade Skingrad. Need to do Restore Darloc Brae Empire decision first

2) Do'krin special building in game (building itself is coded)

3) Restore Darloc Brae Empire: conquer Arenthia and Leaywiin, max prestige level. Very good modifier for all Anequinan counties.

4) Alabasti decision possibly.

5) More Skingrad and later Cyrodiil stuff.

6) Drive out Imperials minor decision (only for kingdom of Rimmen)

7) Make Do'Krin holy site for Two Moons (on decision if possible).

8) Add text for Dagon Decision and make him Merrunz, fix holy sites text and return to  4 (or possibly 5) holy sites
