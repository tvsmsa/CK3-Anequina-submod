	3.2) Leaywiin decision - can choose who to settle: Malaapit, Anequinan or keep Nibenese
	

## TO-DO:

1) Decision to invade Skingrad. Need to do Restore Darloc Brae Empire decision first

2) Modifiers for already existing decisions

	2.1) Arenthia decision - positive Khajiit opinion, negative Bosmer opinion, possibly negative Imperial opinion, maybe diplomacy or intrigue buff. Modifier for Arenthia county (or Rawl'kha).

3) Do'krin special building in game (building itself is coded)

4) Events for already existing decisions

	4.1) Arenthia decision - either just flavour for Arenthia(it gets modifier) or move Arenthia's capital to Rawl'kha and it gets modifier instead(it auto converts culture and faith, maybe add negative modifier for Arenthia).

5) Restore Darloc Brae Empire: conquer Arenthia and Leaywiin, max prestige level. Very good modifier for all Anequinan counties.

6) Alabasti decision possibly.

7) More Skingrad and later Cyrodiil stuff.

8) Drive out Imperials minor decision (only for kingdom of Rimmen)
